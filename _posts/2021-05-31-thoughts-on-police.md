So a lot of this has been on my mind for quite awhile especially with all the drama from this last year but I got into the discussion on police with a relative recently which brought it back to the forefront and thought it was time to at least start talking about it here. A quick summary of the discussion was he thought they did Derek Chauvin dirty at the trial and he was not accountable for restraining someone who resisted arrest and had drugs in their system. Additionally he asserted that the problem was not with the cops but there were too few cops and we desperately needed more in the name of "order". Being I realized I had stepped on a land mine I tried to keep the discussion strictly on the cops in general and side stepped the George Floyd case as I knew I couldn’t win that discussion even with data, and I am glad I didn’t step there as while I knew there was some level of drugs involved I was not familiar enough to correctly state from the top of my head. For reference Floyd did test positive for several drugs but not enough to be the cause of death and at least according to the news did in some form resist arrest. The discussion by and large has kept eating at me as while I tried to convey my thoughts I am not great at verbal debate and in the end they were not persuasive.

While I have not personally had many interactions with the police I have always had a level of skepticism and trepidation around that body of public control. I have always felt in many ways in the U.S. at least, it is a body of high school bullies who went into the profession so they could continue being bullies or worse yet someone who was bullied who went into the field for the feeling of control, the power to now be the bully. If we take that step further in many cases we see the local legislature using the police as bullies to questionably enforce relatively minor infractions in the name of revenue. Outside of the above opinion lets take a look at some actual numbers, something that is actually provable in data like how [approximately 38% of murders, 66% of rapes, 70% of robberies, and 47% of aggravated assaults go uncleared every year](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/06/19/what-does-defund-the-police-mean-and-does-it-have-merit/) or that they only solve [about 2% of all crimes](https://theconversation.com/police-solve-just-2-of-all-major-crimes-143878). That is absolutely abysmal, most people would not still be employed if their numbers were that bad. In addition to being poor at their jobs there is also very little to no oversight of the organizations whose job it supposedly is to protect the people. An organization whose job it is to uphold the law should be held to an even higher standard - an enforceable standard, not something that falls under internal review because outsiders wouldnt understand. A organization is not capable of fully policing itself, sure good policies and an internal review system do help but being part of something makes it more likely that somethings will be allowed to slide.

So what can be done to make improvements to the policing efforts in the U.S.?

Lets start by saying that while on some level my and many of our collective emotions say defund the police and abolish the organization, in my heart (and I would suspect others) know that there is still a reason to have such a peace keeping body for the public good. But acknowledging the need does not mean that such a need can not be met in a different way from a different organization or that severe restructuring isn't needed.

So what can be done immediately with the police organization as it stands today should be our first question. To start, police need to be significantly better educated, it should be a cultural imperative to anyone who wants to go into the profession that you can not and should not enforce something you do not understand. It takes 7 years of formal education to be a lawyer along with significant continued study to appropriately argue in a courtroom but currently a few months to a few years at best to be on the police force. As a first step I would suggest that all officers are required at a minimum to have a similar 4 year degree before entering the field. I don't think you should need a masters to be an officer but similarly to how in the lawyer profession you generally start as some form of aide, I do think for at least the first 3-4 years someone should be considered a junior officer and is not allowed to carry any form of lethal weapon (pepper spray and taser are allowed) as they train alongside a more seasoned office to get their footing.

Having mentioned changing the requirements for an officer to carry a deadly weapon let's explore that a bit further. Let's start by talking about how there are stats that show 9 out of every 10 crimes are [non violent](https://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/police_dispatch_stats/). Or even if you don't like reading that looking [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/upshot/unrest-police-time-violent-crime.html) at how low violent crime actually is in different metros, or that actual crime in general makes up less than 35% of what many cops are involved in. If you're still upset at the above statements, how about that [less than 50](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/12/us/2020-law-enforcement-line-of-duty-deaths-trnd/index.html) officers died from a firearm nationwide? But still officers claim there job is super dangerous, except when you realize policing is rated [22nd](https://www.ishn.com/articles/112748-top-25-most-dangerous-jobs-in-the-united-states) behind professions like collecting garbage or being a delivery driver. Anyone think their Amazon delivery driver should be armed?

Looking again at the New York Times linked article above you will see that police spend more than 40% of their time responding to things that are not even criminally related, which means it is also worth considering at this point about how bringing a weapon into a non criminally related situation is an unnecessary (even if unintentional) escalation of force. While in my discussion with my relative the point of rather having it and not needing it than needing it and not having it came up, I don’t feel the data available appropriately shows cause for this. I'm not saying that an officer shouldnt have a taser or pepper spray but I am saying bring weapons into a situation that doesn't call for it makes everyone jumpy. It makes people respond differently and potentially do things they wouldn’t normally do. I don’t know about you but when I have interactions with the cops I get really nervous, not because I have done something illegal but because I know they could force me to come in, cost me 1000's of dollars in legal fees, or shoot me all at their discretion because they have a "suspicion" for whatever reason. That reason could be as simple a tail light being out you didn’t know about and you swerved to miss a pothole.

So in broader terms here is what I think should happen and how I propose the police should be restructured or rebuilt for the future. First and foremost I think we should stop using the term police as it has become so negative in so many contexts I'm not certain that it can grow beyond its violent and somewhat racist history. Outside of the broader education proposed above as a next step I believe moving funding from our current police system to something new (to be named) that has "Civil Officers" or "Peace Officers' '. While many people will consider these new officers just as social workers, that view is not correct. These new officers should have a minimum of four years of criminal justice education but have specialties in de-escalation training, specialized training in dealing with mental illness or familial abuse situations, and training in dealing with people who may be on a controlled substance or substance abuse. In addition to being more educated on the populations they will be interacting with they should have significant training in self defence, proper restraint, and other hand to hand techniques in the event it is ever necessary. These officers at a maximum will be allowed to carry defensive weapons only. To protect the people, the officer, and to provide oversight all interactions will be filmed end to end. Meaning the vehicle they show up to an interaction in will have multiple cameras recording the outdoor area in which they will be along with the officer being required to have a body cam on at all times during the interaction. If an officer's body cam footage has any kind of gaps or glitches it will prompt an external review of the officers record and their interaction with the public. If an officer's camera dies or runs out of battery they are expected to call for backup to the situation to continue the record of the interaction with the public. It is expected this group of officers will be sent to situations that are non-violent, welfare checks, noise complaints, vagrants, domestics, and potentially someone using drugs.

After "Civil/Peace Officers'' there should be a second level of "Enforcement Officers''. Enforcement Officers will more closely mirror today's police force and will have all the educational and observational safety measures required for Civil officers but have additional weapons and de-escalation training. Enforcement officers may be called as backup by a Civil officer but may not be sent directly to a situation that has not already been reported to have had physical violence, a weapon present, or shots fired. A possible additional consideration for enforcement officers is that in order to use a lethal weapon in a situation in all but responding to a shots fired they would be required to respond to an incident and call in their assessment before having lethal weapons unlocked for use (this may be too onerous, but is worth considering).

While any organization will have some level of internal oversight there will be an unrelated institution whose sole job it is to review the footage and incidents from the Civil and Enforcement officers. In addition to the independent review organization for transparency to the public, all vehicle footage and body cam footage will be publicly accessible from the review institute for at least 12 months. All footage from officers and vehicles is expected to be uploaded to the oversight institute as a matter of course at the end of an officer's shift. If footage is not uploaded within 24 hours it will trigger an automatic review of the officer and his encounters during the prior 3 to 6 month period and the local organization he is part of if anything is found out of place.

In the event an Enforcement Officer is involved in an incident in which a lethal weapon is involved and shots were fired the officer will be placed on two weeks unpaid leave while the oversight institution reviews his record and unless deemed necessary will only be allowed to return as a Civil Officer until the investigation into the incident has been completed or the officer has completed additional training into violent incident resolution measures.

We as a society can also do additional things to make such a future multi-tier enforcement system easier to manage and more effective for the public by having better surveillance systems in place in public areas. In addition to better public area surveillance having requirements for better cameras in business security systems and new rules/laws about how to make security footage from a private business accessible when law enforcement situations occur. I do realize that a lot of privacy concerns come up when it comes to surveillance but I will take a look at and discuss this more in detail in a future post.

At this point let me know what you think? I also will likely talk about qualified immunity and how to resolve riot situations / SWAT and or protests in the future.
