With all the political insanity from this past year I think it’s time we take a little bit of a step back and pause. As we are approaching America's 245th birthday it is worth taking a moment to reassess not only who we were and currently are, but who we want to be. I do believe that throughout its history at certain periods of time we can honestly make the statement that the United States has been the greatest country in the world. We certainly have been one of the most enterprising countries while also providing one of the highest standards of living ever achieved. It is important to remember how the combination of great financial success as a nation, fierce individualism, and the love of a country that allows that individualism and monetary successes allowed us to step in and help win two world wars. That same pioneering effort and desire for more would lead us to make great leaps in technology, medicine, science and would eventually help us land a man on the moon.

When taking such a look at our prior successes I think its important to not just recall them in the limelight but to take a deeper look situationally that allowed us to achieve such things. For most of history it is worth considering that the overwhelming majority of people were coming from a similar background. To refine that a bit more for the early history of the US most people came from an agrarian background (ie they were farmers). While we have continued into a more urbanized society the agrarian roots would hold true through the early part of the 20th century. The events of World War 1 and World War 2 certainly reshaped the economy and brought many people in from the fields and into the military or manufacturing; But while the economy and what folks did changed, so much of it stayed the same. To explain a bit more, after the wars there was still a large amount of cultural homogeneity. Even with the stark amount of change over little more than two decades, culturally the nation still had similar experiences. Maybe you were a veteran of the wars or had worked in manufacturing to support the wars, at the end of the day everyone had sacrificed for something more than themselves and more commonly than not could relate to one another. Not discounting the racism of the time but over all this led to a reasonable economic upswing and continued (while different) post war homogeny. (Note: I do understand this experience was not uniform for all Americans at the time due to other cultural and racial issues but for the point of this post that is not what I am trying to address) This group mentality of achievement lead us into greater achievements after the war up through the early 60's and is a testament to what motivated like-minded people can do. 

For better or worse I believe you can consider the period between the end of the civil war to the landing on the moon one of cultural togetherness. Or at a minimum voting class togetherness. While some of the ideals may have been less than ideal the majority of the populace moved as one. 

Post moon landing you start to see something different. The space race heralded in a new age of technology that was significantly different than any time before and coupling that with the large post war population growth you start to lose some of the group mentality. By the time we had landed a man on the moon many peoples day to day were no longer so similar and had not been in awhile. You start to see the diversification of careers to not just be agricultural or manufacturing but into an entire plethora of new industries. These changes have made our modern world possible but they do pose challenges in that many people no longer see eye to eye or even desire the same thing. For the world to move forward such diversification can be a great thing but for national identity not necessarily.

From the early 70's on forward I'm certain that you can easily bring to mind many of the political disagreements, protests and other major national events that demonstrate we now live in a world of conflicting views and differing opinions. It's somewhat easy to live life when everyone is on the same page (or at least pretends to be) but can be quite the challenge when you have to coalesce many different ideologies to move forward.

Over the past few years we have been exposed to some of the largest propaganda campaigns ever mounted in this country. "Make America Great Again", "Keep America Great", "COVID-19 isn't real", "Q has a plan..." and while I have shown above as a country we have been separating for decades this sort of divisive propaganda is only further dividing us.

So I will pose the question again ... who do we want to be? Do we want to continue to be the shining beacon that we have been in the past? How would we even do that with so many old prejudices still lurking in every corner? Can we (or better yet do we even want to) come together again to maintain America as we have known it?

Rather than "making" or "keeping" America Great I propose its time to "Re-Make" America. 

We already know that we are a very splintered country at this point and there is even research that shows in broad strokes we contain [11 separate nations](https://www.businessinsider.com/regional-differences-united-states-2018-1). I think the question becomes not only who do we want to be, but should we even try to remain the United States as we have known it? Change is constant and we have always been a nation of change, some changes are bigger than others and I personally feel that if we are not currently at that inflection point we will be very soon. We are in the process of the changing of the guard but the old guard has spent so irresponsibly and left such a disaster that it's a steep hill to climb.

So what do I actually propose ...?

National correction could take several different paths to achieving something better and while this is a very broad topic I will touch on just a few ideas here. Many of the ideas I am about to state will likely become deeper posts on their own so please bear with me for the time it takes to put these to paper.

One idea that I personally like is the idea of the city state. Someone only has to glance at an electoral map to know that many cities represent a group of homogeneous individuals and the rural areas another. This is not to say that different cities don't have different ideals or different rural areas all agree on everything but we can see there are distinct and consistent group differences between these geographic regions. For this reason one such way we may be able to improve our country's function is to recognize large metro areas similar to states and allow for cities to have their own senate and house seats. By recognizing cities in a similar capacity to states yet separate it allows an appropriate separation of concerns between urban and rural communities. It keeps the larger populace of the city from inappropriately swinging votes in rural areas and allows rural electees to better focus on issues in their local community.

Another idea that would have benefits for the above but stands in its own right is to end gerrymandering and to create a more uniform grid area for where our elected officials are based. While districts are drawn based on population there should be new law in place that all districts be drawn as uniformly as possible while encompassing the apportioned amount of people. This could be as simple as every state is gridded into squares and combined with another square if the population is lacking to a square being subdivided into further squares as necessary dictated by the population. This could even go so far as gridding the country without regard for state lines to ensure for a fair representation at a federal level. A note to the city state idea above, the district drawing process would be significantly simplified if large metropolises were removed from the equation.

A broader more extreme idea would be to break the country into a number of smaller countries (perhaps based on the linked map) and then to remain united more similar to the EU in that we agree on trade laws and military endeavors but outside of those major issues allows self governance of more homogenous regions. Such an arrangement as this would allow the south and the midwest to maintain their more conservative views while allowing the coasts to be more progressive without these geographic regions being beholden to one another on the day to day. It could even allow Texas to be Texas after all these years.

As an opposite of the above we could also go the other direction and break states into much smaller entities with increased representation at the federal level. By going smaller this would open the chance for a much more varied electorate with a good chance that many smaller third parties might finally gain some representation that would by and large more accurately reflect the true demographics of our nation. 

While the above ideas do take a shot at making our differences more manageable it still doesn’t really answer the question of who do we want to be ... or does it? The first step fixing a problem is admitting you have a problem, and we (for the most part) recognize we have a problem. So let’s be the country that is willing to look at our problems head on and be creative about solving them. Let’s continue to be the shining example we have been in the past and embrace some new ideas to not just survive politically and as a nation but to thrive and to show other nations how to overcome the deadlock that so often becomes the downfall of nations. Let’s continue to let our freedoms ring either as a federation of individual homogenous nations or as the most equitably represented country for homogenous groups of interest.

So as we approach our national 245th birthday we are creaking at the seams. Let's pause for a moment and consider how we can embrace the change that has always been a part of the nation and continue growing. Let's Re-Make America. Happy 4th of July.
