Today we need to think bigger, and not just by a little bit. With everything going on in the world and the cracks of late capitalism showing themselves more everyday its time to consider something a little bit different. 

While I am just getting started publicly writing and puting my ideas out there I think its important to make these few notes before we get started. According to most political tests I'm a slightly right leaning centerist, I like black coffee, whiskey, and guns but at the same time feel we have a social duty to build a better society. We have alot of room to grow as a inclusive and more caring civilation. I am not a republican or tea partier, or a Trumpist. I have libertarian leanings but thats not fully correct either. I am certainly not a communist, while Marx had some interesting ideas we have shown time and again that, that system has sever flaws. Socialism alone seems ok but is plauged with very high taxs and government debts that run to borderline insolvency (I'll most likely talk about that in another post). The United States two party system is clearly broken at this point and time and I think that most people would say has been reasonably non-functional for the will of the people for the last several decades. I do believe in capitalism but I also believe that unlimited growth is not possible and unchecked capitalism is a ponzi scheme at best.

Now having given you a small idea of where my head is at I propose that its time to actually develop a new form of government. We certainly have lots of history to draw on at this point as to how different societies work. We can consider the 20th century a playground of political ideas but I truly believe it is time to move past the experimentation phase and start picking the winning ideas and building something better. Time for a little history lesson ...

Prior to 1800 the majority of the world would have fallen under some form of authoritarian monarchy, possibly a form of oligarchy or varying forms of tribalism (even which many times would have had some form of authoritarian leadership). As stated prior we can go with the 19th and 20th centuries being a trial run of multiple different styles of government with the trials of socialism, communism, nazism, and semi-wide spread democratic variants. I believe that one could argue that democratic systems have mostly won out of the trials due to their base economic system of capitalism and that it inspires the populace to work hard and acheive their goals. I think its fair to say at this point most people are not inspired to work hard just to support society, everyone wants to get ahead and a capitalist society allows for this. The work is directly related to the reward. I dont think however that we need to be so selfish that we cant build a better society out of capitalism. While democracy and capitalism has proven to be successful and a reasonably stable system it does have short comings. 

To start out let’s look at a few of the shortcomings of democracy and capitalism. This particular combination of systems has a unique way of lending itself to both meritocracies and oligarchism. In on sense there is nothing wrong with this, if an individual works hard they deserve to enjoy they fruits of their labor, merit based systems work and generally provide the proper level of incentive to continue doing better. There is nothing inherently wrong with reaching oligarch status (the Musks, Bezos, Gates of the world). The issues start to creep in when the base level of “merit” gets too high and those who have reached the top of the pile start to exploit the system for further benefit. This is not to say we don’t want the best and the brightest, your maximum effort, or that being well off doesnt have its perks, but to call attention to the fact not everything needs such a high bar (ie you shouldn’t need a bachelors to make coffee - but this is not to say you should be uneducated) and that those with power should not take advantage of others situations. Meritocracies also lend themselves to competition, once again I think this is a very good thing as it inspires us to new hights, to build a better wheel, the downside to this is there will always be losers. I also think this is a good thing. People and societies need to understand how to lose or fail as everyone and everything will fail at some point. But we have created a problem in our modern world at least in large portions of the developed west and that is that anymore, failure in modern society can literally be life and death. 

While times have always been challenging for the poorer tiers of society failure in the past at least work related failures were many times recoverable. This is not to say that the hunter that failed to shoot a deer didnt starve or that many an idea didnt end in death or dismemberment but rather with the bar to succeed being rather low, the populace had the ability to rebound. Much of the developed world was still largly argrarian less than 150 years ago and if crops didnt do well you learned from it and tried again next year. More than likely you lived with extended family and with a combination of everyones help you were able to get by. In the event you wernt a farmer and worked in early factories there was no bar for entrance other than you showed up and worked hard, they would train you to what you needed to do. In the event you were let go or the factory closed there was another one down the road that would also potentially hire you and train you into the position. Even as this low bar has dwindled this remained somewhat true even into the early 90's in my opinion but the bar of success has exponentially been raised in the the previous 30-40 years.

In general I dont think raising the bar is a bad thing, it continues to push us as a society, as the human race to be better, to acheive more, but we need to make sure that we allow for a safety net so that we can continue to achieve and inovate. Europe and Japan have a limited example of this through some of the social services that they provide but are not inclusive of everything we need. Here in the U.S. with a lack of so many basic services it is absolutly crucial to succeed. Failure here likely means a lifetime of debt and a less than zero chance of achieving the so called "American Dream TM". It is easy to fail in America and once you have failed to be trapped there virtually forever in a semi downward spiral. This could be something as simple as not understanding how basic interest works on credit cards and trapping yourself in a debt cycle early in life, to way over spending on a college degree for a job that will be lucky to pay 40k if you can find one. Its also entirely too easy to fall into poverty in the U.S by no fault of your own and being crushed with medical debt from an accident or ailment you had no choice in. One could argue you should just work harder it is the American ethos and while I was very much raised to believe this not only as a fact but as a God given truth it is no longer possible to look past the disconnect in wages and productivity of the last 50 years. It is no longer possible to ignore the fact that our grandparents could purchase a house for an average of 3 years salary from a single income household and comfortably provide for a family of 4 or 5 with a dog when it now costs 11 times the average annual salary for the average home.

While we are certainly no longer the free'est country in the world we are still by far the richest on average which makes it incomprehensible that an average family should struggle so much just to keep a roof over their heads. To be beyond bankrupt if they have a single major medical expense. How is that acceptable in the richest country in the world?

To bring it back to my starting point, its time for something else. Call it socialism on steriods or social libertarianism or some new unthought of term at this point but it is time to put together a new idea and not be stuck on the old world definition of types of government we learned about in our teen years. I fully believe it is possible to build a new society that allows for the "New Dream TM" whatever you deem that to be and still take care of the majority of the populace. The money is there, dont let anyone, any news station, anyone in the old guard tell you its not because it is (I've crunched the rough numbers and will share them in a future post). Please bear with me on this journey to a new understanding of our world and what it means to live on this planet. Dont get stuck on political terms or old ideas of what it means to be such n such, this thought process is not to stir up ire about old political ideologies but to put together a better future we all want to live in.
