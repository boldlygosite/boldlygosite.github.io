America is the religion of the world, and the religion of America is America, and if America is the religion, money is Americas version of Jesus Christ. Now take a moment and get over being incensed at that statment... I'll wait, good? Ok, lets take this and explore it a bit further as there is a lot to unpack here. Lets first start by looking at the definition of what a religion is. Outside of a belief in a god religion can commonly be defined as either "a particular system of faith and worship" or "a pursuit or interest to which someone ascribes supreme importance". Either of those definitions can reasonably describe America but lets be a bit more specific.

In years past I would have described the true religion of America not as christianity but as money, the power of the almighty dollar. I think thats a good short summary statement of the state of the country but I've come to realize that that statement is far to simple for what is really occuring. They have been made great by there faith and worship of money and when I say faith I do mean faith. Their entire economic system works on the faith of the dollar, the greenback, fat stacks of Benjamins. So what exactly do I mean by the statement that money works on faith? Exactly that, we have been a fiat currency since 1976, meaning the money isn't backed by anything. It is litterally paper and it is only worth something because we believe it to be worth something. It only has a percieved value because we have been taught that it has a value that the government will support it but in reality it is just a piece of paper. If we want to get technical about it, it is not even technically backed by the government but rather by a private institution that works closly with the government (but I digress discussing these technicallities will be saved for a later date). This is why I said at the start it is best to consider money like Jesus to America as it requires belief to work.

I would say that over all money is the number one value in this country. You get up every day and grind, you hustle, you go out and get this bread. In one sense this is one of the great things about America is you can come here with nothing and make a living and not just make a living but truly succeed in life. It may be significantly more difficult than it used to be but it is still possible if your willing to sacrifice enough to make it happen #americanDream. 

The ability to come to America and be successfull is undeniably a major draw world wide and I would go so far as to make the statment it qualifies America as a religion unto itself. While we have done many great things for the world at large there are many places that hate America and think its the bad guy yet given the chance many citizens from those same places wouldn't hesitate to come here for a chance at a better life (see second definition above). Even in the event that people around the world may not want to come here much of the world is reliant on Americas protection or generosity in aide dollars. One may even say they have the patron saint of the United States.

Having qualified why America is the religion of the world and why money is the equivalent to Jesus, lets now discuss why America is a religion unto itself. In one way I think it could be argued that America has always been a religion. It is an idea to be believed in. To be practiced. To exercise your freedom in the way that you see fit. One easy way to see this is their excesive use of putting the flag on everything. Another way to view this from the homefront is as traditional religion has waned it is possible to see ideaological party politics significantly increase. Over the past 20 years religious service attendance is down approximately 20% and we see a significant rise in how tightly we
